   <pre>cd Game-Pidgeon-Anagrams</pre>
2. Install modules using pip:
   <pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
3. Make sure you have iPhone Mirroring launched and on the Anagrams start screen
4. Press start
5. Run the .py file!

6. Quickly go to the iPhone Mirroring application and wait for the OCR to run
5. If the console tells you that the OCR did not work, enter letters manually in 1 word (ABCDEF)
6. Let the program move the mouse while you just keep clicking
7. When stopping the program, it may perform the last few clicks / movements!!!!!!! (I do not know why)
